# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Royale
Simulation of a battle between the classical Jokenpo game elements.

The idea of this project is to create an "battlefield" in which rocks, papers and scissors fight each other, leaving only one left in the end.
The "fight" occurs every time that a collision happens, where the winner converts the loser to his side, following the well-known rules of the famous hand game:
Rock rocks scissors, scissors cut paper and paper folds rocks.
